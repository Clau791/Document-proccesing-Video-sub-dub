1
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,099
Hang it one step at a time on xessoirs.

2
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,080
Casualties and zombies.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,420
Look, it looks like police electrodes.

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,039
It's the same thing with ham
older, but he's got a better chance.

5
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,500
Hang him up and let him get away with
a setup where he's already warmed up.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,539
I think it's coming into my hands.

7
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,539
We're on the scrub, then
we're always grilling,

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,320
If you're fucking sick, you'll be okay.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,640
The most important thing
is that it's enlarged.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,280
number of degnostic
regimes and correction.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,100
My useful regime is being used in sin.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,719
A standard of two robotial
double-corrections,

13
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,820
It's built for this
technology out of the way.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,920
If we found a problem on the right
side, we're picking all the rights.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,780
And one left.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I mean, it's the effect of
seeing a head on the coridzards in

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
The parties.

18
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,340
It's literally, and it's
the other way around.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,659
So we're leveling the
potential on the side.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,920
There's a TRR regime here next.

21
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,180
That's his TRR regime.

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,439
So we don't connect like we always do.

23
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,540
And here's the, uh, the most
interesting move, that's...

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
Ten fingers.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,879
We're working right now,

26
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,400
So 145 dimensions is awful much.

27
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,359
But I've been asked to talk to you.

28
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:43,900
I mean, we had a thumb with all
our fingers, every possible finger.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,939
Sit down.

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,480
And we take the worst dimension.

31
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,859
And let's go.

32
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,120
I mean, 10 fingers,

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
It's a bad change here.

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,280
And then we work on them.

35
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,099
For as long as they
show up, or they don't.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,640
That's the regime and the Zoe.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,120
It's a health Indian who
provides food and a soy.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,460
And Zoe.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
And.

40
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,139
Zoe, literally.

41
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,919
The Reverend Queen.

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,860
It's the right thing to do.

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,360
A lot of people ask how much an
option-dependent device costs.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,879
In that simple version of
400 grand, sending away,

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm going to have to go to the back of
the house with an electrician and a commie

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,955
camera.

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,419
At the session, we're going to show
those semptics to the program-director.

48
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,439
In a joyous line.

49
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,500
I don't know how many tons I've made.

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,580
It's 400-40 and it's a maximum aboard.

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,819
It's 500-600.

52
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,379
Well, these aren't very expensive
for the Sfar until it's serial.

53
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,379
Production.

54
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,099
But he's either working
on it all the time.

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,259
So for now, the scenes aren't
complicated, they're not rubbing.

56
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,340
But the forward-looking device
is very, I mean, hears delivered.

57
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,419
All in one, three in one.

58
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,280
All the programs are in a bunch.

59
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,340
The programs aren't connected, you see.

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,020
Looks like it's increasing
from the surface.

61
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,340
And the most important thing
is that we're having an effect,

62
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,459
Then right after the study,
you have to do it again,

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,639
See what happened, you see the result.
